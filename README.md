I designed and implemented a comprehensive maze-solving application, featuring maze generation using Kruskal's algorithm with the Union/Find data structure. 
The Impworld library facilitated graphical representation, enabling users to visually see the maze creation process. Additionally, I integrated graphical
maze-solving capabilities, using both Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms. The animated search process dynamically displays exploration
and solution paths. The user interaction is enhanced through options to choose from different search algorithms, creating new random mazes, and having the
ability to toggle the visibility of visited paths. Further functionalities include tracking wrong moves, comparing algorithm steps, and enabling manual maze
traversal using input via keyboard. Thorough testing has been conducted to ensure the robust performance of the implemented features.
